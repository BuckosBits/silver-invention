    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and
      XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and
      the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM specification,
      the term "document" is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a
      way of representing many different kinds of information that may
      be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally
      be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML presents
      this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data.</p>

    <p>With the Document
      Object Model, programmers can build documents, navigate
      their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content.
      Anything found in an HTML or XML document can be accessed,
      changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object Model,
      with a few exceptions - in particular, the DOM interfaces for
      the XML internal and external subsets have not yet been specified.</p>
    <p>As a W3C specification, one important objective for the Document
      Object Model is to provide a standard programming interface that
      can be used in a wide variety of environments and applications.
      The DOM is designed to be used with any programming
      language. In order to provide a precise, language-independent specification 
      of the DOM interfaces, we have chosen to define 
      the specifications in OMG IDL, as defined in the <loc
      href="http://www.omg.org/corba/corbiiop.htm">CORBA 2.2
      specification.</loc>  In addition to the OMG IDL specification,
      we provide language bindings for Java and ECMAScript (an
      industry-standard scripting language based on JavaScript and
      JScript). </p>
    <note><p>OMG IDL is used only as a language-independent and
	implementation-neutral way to specify interfaces. Various other
	IDLs could have been used. In general, IDLs are designed for
	specific computing environments. The Document Object Model 
	can be implemented in any computing environment, and does not 
	require the object binding runtimes generally associated with 
	such IDLs.

    <head>What the Document Object Model is</head>
    <p>The DOM is a programming API for documents.
      It closely resembles the structure of the
      documents it models. For instance, consider this table, taken
      from an HTML document: </p>
    <eg role='code'>
      &lt;TABLE&gt;
      &lt;TBODY&gt; 
      &lt;TR&gt; 
      &lt;TD&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/TD&gt;
      &lt;TD&gt;Aeolian&lt;/TD&gt; 
      &lt;/TR&gt; 
      &lt;TR&gt;
      &lt;TD&gt;Over the River, Charlie&lt;/TD&gt;        
      &lt;TD&gt;Dorian&lt;/TD&gt; 
      &lt;/TR&gt; 
      &lt;/TBODY&gt;
      &lt;/TABLE&gt;
    </eg> 
    <p>The DOM represents this table like this:    
      <graphic source="./images/table.gif" alt="DOM representation of the example table"/>
    </p>
    <p>In the DOM, documents have a logical
      structure which is very much like a tree; to be more precise, it
      is like a &quot;forest&quot; or &quot;grove&quot;, which can
      contain more than one tree. However, the DOM
      does not specify that documents must be <emph>implemented</emph> as a
      tree or a grove<!--but not the same as an sgml grove-->, nor
      does it specify how the relationships among objects be
      implemented. The DOM is a logical model that may be implemented in any
      convenient manner. In this
      specification, we use the term <emph>structure model</emph> to
      describe the tree-like representation of a document; we
      specifically avoid terms like &quot;tree&quot; or
      &quot;grove&quot; in order to avoid implying a particular
      implementation. One important property of DOM structure models
      is <emph>structural isomorphism</emph>: if any two Document
      Object Model implementations are used to create a representation
      of the same document, they will create the same structure model,
      with precisely the same objects and relationships.</p>
      <p>The name &quot;Document Object Model&quot; was chosen because
      it is an &quot;object model&quot; in the traditional
      object oriented design sense: documents are modeled using
      objects, and the model encompasses not only the structure of a
      document, but also the behavior of a document and the objects
      of which it is composed. In other words, the nodes in the
      above diagram do not represent a data structure, they
      represent objects, which have functions and identity. As an
      object model, the DOM identifies:</p>
    <ulist>
      <item><p>the interfaces and objects used to represent and manipulate
	  a document</p></item>
      <item><p>the semantics of these interfaces and objects - including
	  both behavior and attributes</p></item>
      <item><p>the relationships and collaborations among these interfaces
	  and objects</p></item>
    </ulist>
    
    <p>The structure of SGML documents has traditionally been
      represented by an abstract data model, not by an object model.
      In an abstract data model, the model is centered around the
      data. In object oriented programming languages, the data itself
      is encapsulated in objects that hide the data, protecting it
      from direct external manipulation. The functions associated with
      these objects determine how the objects may be manipulated, and
      they are part of the object model.</p>
    <p>The Document Object Model currently consists of two parts,
      DOM Core and DOM HTML. The DOM Core represents the
      functionality  used for XML documents, and also serves as the
      basis for DOM HTML. 

	A compliant implementation of the DOM must implement all of the 
	fundamental interfaces in the Core chapter with the semantics as 
	defined. Further, it must implement at least one of the HTML DOM 
	and the extended (XML) interfaces with the semantics as defined.
	</p>

  <div2 id="ID-E7C30822">
    <head>What the Document Object Model is not</head>
    <p>This section is designed to give a more precise understanding
      of the DOM by distinguishing it from other
      systems that may seem to be like it.</p>
    <ulist>
      <item><p>Although the Document Object Model was strongly influenced
	  by "Dynamic HTML", in Level 1, it does not implement all of
	  "Dynamic HTML". In particular, events have not yet been defined.
	  Level 1 is designed to lay a firm foundation for this kind
	  of functionality by providing a robust, flexible model of the
	  document itself.</p></item>
      <item><p>The Document Object Model is not a binary specification.
	  DOM programs written in the same language will be
	  source code compatible across platforms, but the DOM
	  does not define any form of binary interoperability.</p></item>
      <item><p>The Document Object Model is not a way of persisting objects
	  to XML or HTML. Instead of specifying how objects may be
	  represented in XML, the DOM specifies how
	  XML and HTML documents are represented as objects, so that
	  they may be used in object oriented programs.</p></item>
      <item><p>The Document Object Model is not a set of data structures,
	  it is an object model that specifies interfaces. Although this
	  document contains diagrams showing parent/child relationships,
	  these are logical relationships defined by the programming
	  interfaces, not representations of any particular internal
	  data structures.</p></item>
      <item><p>The Document Object Model does not define &quot;the true
	  inner semantics&quot; of XML or HTML. The semantics of those
	  languages are defined by W3C Recommendations for these languages.
	  The DOM is a programming model designed to
	  respect these semantics. The DOM does not
	  have any ramifications for the way you write XML and HTML
	  documents; any document that can be written in these languages
	  can be represented in the DOM.</p></item>

      <item><p>The Document Object Model, despite its name, is not a
	  competitor to the Component Object Model (COM). COM, like
	  CORBA, is a language independent way to specify interfaces and
	  objects; the DOM is a set of interfaces and
	  objects designed for managing HTML and XML documents. The DOM
	  may be implemented using language-independent systems like COM
	  or CORBA; it may also be implemented using language-specific
	  bindings like the Java or ECMAScript bindings specified in
	  this document.</p></item>
    </ulist>
  </div2>
  <div2 id="ID-E7C30823">
    <head>Where the Document Object Model came from</head>
    <p>The DOM originated as a specification to
      allow JavaScript scripts and Java programs to be portable among
      Web browsers.  "Dynamic HTML" was  the immediate ancestor of the
      Document Object Model, and it was originally thought of largely
      in terms of  browsers. However, when the DOM
      Working Group was formed at W3C, it was also joined by vendors in other
      domains, including HTML or XML editors and document
      repositories. Several of these vendors had worked with SGML
      before XML was developed; as a result, the DOM
      has been influenced by SGML Groves and the HyTime standard. Some
      of these vendors had also developed their own object models for
      documents in order to provide an API for SGML/XML
      editors or document repositories, and these object models have
      also influenced the DOM. </p>
  </div2>
  

  <div2 id="ID-E7C30824"><head>Entities and the DOM Core</head>
    <p>In the fundamental DOM interfaces, there are no objects representing
      entities. Numeric character references, and references to the
      pre-defined entities in HTML and XML, are replaced by the
      single character that makes up the entity's replacement.
      For example, in:   
      <eg role='code'>
        &lt;p&gt;This is a dog &amp;amp; a cat&lt;/p&gt;        
      </eg>
      the "&amp;amp;" will be replaced by the character "&amp;", and the text
      in the P element will form a single continuous sequence of
      characters. Since numeric character references and pre-defined entities
      are not recognized as such in CDATA sections, or the SCRIPT and STYLE
      elements in HTML, they are not replaced by the single character they
      appear to refer to. If the example above were enclosed in a CDATA
      section, the "&amp;amp;" would not be replaced by "&amp;"; neither would
      the &lt;p&gt; be recognized as a start tag. The representation of general
      entities, both internal and external, are defined within the
      extended (XML) interfaces of the Level 1 specification.</p>
    <p>
      Note: When a DOM representation of a document is serialized
      as XML or HTML text, applications will need to check each
      character in text data to see if it needs to be escaped
      using a numeric or pre-defined entity. Failing to do so
      could result in invalid HTML or XML. Also, implementations should be
      aware of the fact that serialization into a character encoding
      ("charset") that does not fully cover ISO 10646 may fail if there are
      characters in markup or CDATA sections that are not present in the
      encoding.</p>
  </div2>

  <div2 id="ID-E7C30826"><head>DOM Interfaces and DOM Implementations</head>

    <p>The DOM specifies interfaces which may be used to manage XML or
      HTML documents. It is important to realize that these interfaces
      are an abstraction - much like "abstract base classes" in C++,
      they are a means of specifying a way to access and manipulate an
      application's internal representation of a document. Interfaces 
	do not imply a particular concrete
      implementation. Each DOM application is free to maintain
      documents in any convenient representation, as long as the
      interfaces shown in this specification are supported. Some
      DOM implementations will be existing programs that use the
      DOM interfaces to access software written long before the
      DOM specification existed. Therefore, the DOM is designed
      to avoid implementation dependencies; in particular,</p>
    <olist>
      <item><p>Attributes defined in the IDL do not imply concrete
	  objects which must have specific data members - in the
	  language bindings, they are translated to a pair of
	  get()/set() functions, not to a data member. (Read-only
	  functions have only a get() function in the language
	  bindings).  </p>
      </item>
      <item><p>DOM applications may provide additional interfaces
	  and objects not found in this specification and still be
	  considered DOM compliant.</p></item>
      <item><p>Because we specify interfaces and not the actual
	  objects that are to be created, the DOM can not know what
	  constructors to call for an implementation.  In general,
	  DOM users call the createXXX() methods on the Document
	  class to create document structures, and DOM
	  implementations create their own internal representations
	  of these structures in their implementations of the
	  createXXX() functions.
	</p></item>
      </olist>
  </div2>
  <div2 id="ID-E7C30825">
    <head>Limitations of Level 1</head> 
    <p>
      The DOM Level 1 specification is intentionally limited to 
      those methods needed to represent and manipulate document 
      structure and content.
      The plan is for future Levels of the DOM specification to provide:
      
      <olist>
	<item><p> A structure model for the internal subset and the
	    external subset.</p></item>
	<item><p> Validation against a schema.</p></item>
	<item><p> Control for rendering documents via style sheets.</p></item>
	<item><p> Access control.</p></item>
	<item><p> Thread-safety.</p></item>
	<item><p> Events.</p></item>
